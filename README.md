Solving Project Euler challenges in Rust
==========================================

Attempt to solve [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/) challenges to improving my math and Rust knowledge.

When a solution is found, a new unit test is added. Some benchmarks are in place to enable comparison between provided implementations.

This is a work in progress.

## Requirements

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


## Running tests and benchmarks

Use `cargo test` to run unit tests. To run only one specific problem unit test, use: `cargo test problem<n>`.

To compare solutions benchmark run: `cargo bench`.
